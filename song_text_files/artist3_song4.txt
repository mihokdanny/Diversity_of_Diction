Baby let me be your lovin teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be your teddy bear

I don't wanna be a tiger
Cause tigers play to rough
I don't wanna be a lion
Cause lions ain't the kind
You love enough

I just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be your teddy bear

Baby let me be around you every night
Run your fingers though my hair
And cuddle me really tight
Oh let me be your teddy bear

I don't wanna be a tiger
Cause tigers play to rough
I don't wanna be a lion
Cause lions ain't the kind
You love enough

I just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be your teddy bear

Oh let me be your teddy bear
I just wanna be your teddy bear
