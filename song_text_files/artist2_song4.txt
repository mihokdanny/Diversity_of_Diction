I was feeling the blues, I was watchin' the news
When this fella came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you that science has proved
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin', without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll and I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town


So bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man


Oh, now I've gotta say that the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind, by leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
And I've gotta say that I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home


So bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, we'll never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man


Bring... bring... bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
And say hello to her good timin' man


Bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
And we will never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand...
