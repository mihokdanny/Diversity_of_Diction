Thousands of pounds of dirt pressed on his chest, squeezing and squeezing until he could not draw another breath.\",\n",
       " 'His mother, Michelle Marts, was the first in his family to hear.',\n",
       " \"''You just stand there like you're suspended in blank space,'' she said of that moment. She remembers being enveloped by a paralyzing numbness. He was her only child. She could not hear or breathe or move. Was this, she found herself wondering, what Patrick felt?\",\n",
       " \"She called Patrick's father, her ex-husband, Jeff. ''It literally knocked me off my feet,'' he said. ''I lay there, right there on the floor, screaming and crying.''\",\n",
       " \"Mrs. Marts next called Patrick's wife, Crystal. ''I remember running upstairs and just hugging my kid and thinking, 'How am I going to tell her,' '' Ms. Walters said.\",\n",
       " \"Soon after, an investigator from the coroner's office called Mrs. Marts. He could not have been nicer. Such a tragedy, he said. But by then, the first insistent questions had begun to form. Her son had often spoken about his fear of being buried alive. He had described being sent into deep trenches without safety equipment, like the large metal boxes placed in excavations to create a sheltered workspace.\",\n",
       " \"''Was there a trench box?'' she asked the investigator. He paused, she recalled. ''He says, 'Ma'am, no safety procedures were followed. None.'\",\n",
       " \"''He was just so disgusted.''\",\n",
       " \"Other officials shared his disgust, starting with the federal safety investigator who stood over the trench that night as Patrick Walters's body was pulled from the mud. Only two weeks before, the same investigator had caught men from the same company -- Moeves Plumbing -- working unprotected in a 15-foot-deep trench, a blatant violation of federal safety laws.\",\n",
       " 'One of the men was Patrick Walters, who, when questioned by the investigator, had described a host of unsafe work practices.',\n",
       " \"''They don't like me on these jobs a lot,'' Mr. Walters had volunteered, according to a tape recording of the interview.\",\n",
       " \"''Why is that?''\",\n",
       " \"''Because, I don't like getting in the holes -- even with a box.''\",\n",
       " \"The inspector's boss, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration's top official in Cincinnati, was angry too. He knew Moeves Plumbing well. In 1989, he had confronted the company over another death. The circumstances were nearly identical: a deep trench, no box, a man buried alive.\",\n",
       " \"But their professional disgust could not touch the pure rage of Patrick Walters's parents. A veteran plumber himself, Jeff Walters knew the treachery of trench walls. Moeves Plumbing would deny any wrongdoing and tell OSHA it was trying to do the right thing on safety. But to Jeff Walters, sending an untrained, unskilled apprentice into an unprotected, unstable, rain-saturated, 10-foot-deep trench was flat-out criminal.\",\n",
       " \"''You done killed my boy!'' he recalls screaming that night on the phone to Moeves Plumbing.\",\n",
       " 'His first instinct was revenge by shotgun. His wife and members of his church intervened. They prayed and wept, and then they resolved to seek their justice from the authorities instead.',\n",
       " 'The entire family mobilized around this goal. Over the next six months, they gathered records, interviewed witnesses and learned all they could about OSHA. Blue collar and self-reliant, they did not expect much from government. Indeed, their research turned up plenty of unflattering descriptions of OSHA. Inept. Timid. Overmatched. Jeff Walters knew OSHA as the guys who would sweat the small stuff -- show up at a job site and write up a $5,000 fine for a frayed power cord.',\n",
       " 'Even so, year after year, grieving families across America depend on OSHA to stand for them, and for their dead. Surely, the Walters family reasoned, if OSHA had any purpose at all it was to keep employers from repeatedly killing workers by flouting safety rules.',\n",
       " \"It is a federal crime for an employer to cause a worker's death by willfully violating safety laws. To initiate a prosecution, OSHA must first refer the case to the Department of Justice. Yet, even in the very worst cases, that is something the agency does only a small fraction of the time.\",\n",
       " 'To the Walters family, though, it seemed like such a small thing to ask for -- a simple request from one bureaucracy to another to take a look, consider the evidence and decide whether to prosecute. That was it.',\n",
       " \"''It looked like an open-and-shut case,'' Mrs. Marts said. ''No box. Put down in a hole. Buried alive.''\",\n",
       " 'An Apprentice Looking to Please',\n",
       " 'There was still mud in his ears.',\n",
       " 'Patrick Walters was laid out in his coffin for the visitation, his face puffy and bruised, his ears still flecked with dried bits of clay. They all noticed.',\n",
       " \"''Mom, can I put this in with Dad?'' Crystal Walters's 4-year-old daughter, Christen, asked, holding up one of her drawings.\",\n",
       " \"Patrick Walters was not Christen's father, but he had raised her as his own. Young, financially pressed and prone to quarrel, Patrick and Crystal Walters had married in 2000; they were separated at the time of his death, but still trying. ''I loved him,'' Ms. Walters, 22, said. ''Still do.''\",\n",
       " 'Looking at him there that day, Ms. Walters found the whole thing incomprehensible, she said. With his linebacker build and nonstop motor, her husband had seemed so indestructible.',\n",
       " \"But it was dangerous work, and he had known it. He told his mother of being buried to his waist in one trench. He told his father of being lowered into trenches on the bucket of a backhoe, leaving him no ladder to escape a collapse. ''I just ask God never to let me die that way,'' he said to his wife.\",\n",
       " \"His family urged him to put up a fuss. But he pointed out that he was only an apprentice, easily replaced. If he was seen as a troublemaker, he worried, his bosses would find an excuse to get rid of him. Their attitude, he told his father, was ''either do it or go home.''\",\n",
       " \"And in truth, he did not have many better alternatives. His troubles in school had begun when he was 10, the same year his parents' marriage broke up. By 16, he was running afoul of the law. An episode involving stolen guns and then a police chase resulted in a stretch in juvenile detention.\",\n",
       " \"''The best thing that ever happened to him,'' his father said.\",\n",
       " 'Still, an arrest record and a G.E.D. earned him only dead-end temporary jobs in factories. He cleaned animal cages. Whatever the dangers, he saw Moeves Plumbing as his big break.',\n",
       " \"Small and family owned, about 50 employees, Moeves (pronounced MAY-vis) had agreed to pay for his four-year apprentice program. That would mean a plumber's license and $25 an hour and a decent middle-class life for him and Crystal and Christen.\",\n",
       " \"''He was looking at Moeves like this is my road, my way forward,'' his father said. There was even talk of them one day forming Walters & Son Plumbing.\",\n",
       " 'It was a hard road for $8.50 an hour. But he stuck with it. He put in hard days on the job, then went to school three nights a week. School records show that he missed only three classes. His grades were good.',\n",
       " \"''A miracle,'' his mother said.\",\n",
       " 'His father saw a boy becoming a man.',\n",
       " 'The Physics of the Trench',\n",
       " 'On May 31, 2002, a local fire chief called the Cincinnati OSHA office to complain that men were installing a storm drain in an unsafe trench. Charles Shelton, a veteran OSHA compliance officer, was at the scene in less than an hour.',\n",
       " 'Every trench is a potential death trap. Trench walls give way at any time, often without warning. The deeper the trench the greater the risk, which is magnified further if the soil is loose or wet. Hundreds are killed or injured in trenches each year.',\n",
       " \"That is why federal safety laws require employers to take special precautions for trenches deeper than five feet. The walls must be sloped back at a safe angle or shored up with bracing. If a trench box is used instead, it must be big and sturdy enough to withstand the tremendous forces of a collapse. A ''competent person'' -- someone trained in excavation safety -- must inspect the trench before work begins and then daily thereafter.\",\n",
       " 'From a parking lot, Mr. Shelton watched the workers from Moeves Plumbing. One was Patrick Walters. Mr. Shelton approached with a video camera. The trench, about 15 feet deep, was neither sloped nor shored. There was a box, but it was far too small -- only eight feet tall -- to be effective. And Mr. Shelton had seen men working outside even that undersize shelter.',\n",
       " \"He shut the job down on a Friday afternoon. On Monday, at 9:22 a.m., he turned on his tape recorder to interview Patrick Walters. ''Employees were working in an excavation that was unprotected,'' Mr. Shelton began, ''and I've got this young man, he was exposed to the trench.''\",\n",
       " 'His voice was noticeably nervous, but Patrick Walters described a company that did not follow the basic requirements of trench safety. He told of supervisors who tolerated dangerous shortcuts and made little effort to enforce safety rules.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Shelton asked about safety meetings.',\n",
       " \"''We've had a couple,'' Mr. Walters said. ''They don't do it regularly anymore.'' He then volunteered that the company no longer had a safety manager.\",\n",
       " \"''How long has he been gone?''\",\n",
       " \"''I can't remember. It's been a while since we had one.''\",\n",
       " 'It had been more than three months.',\n",
       " \"The safety manager, Robert W. Schum, who left Moeves Plumbing with his son and formed his own company, said in a recent interview that his duties had actually involved ''very little safety.'' His main job, he explained, was managing the warehouse. Sometimes he would check toolboxes for frayed power cords. That was about it. In some two years as safety manager, he said, he could not recall giving any training on trench safety.\",\n",
       " 'The month after he left, Moeves Plumbing sent three supervisors to a training course on trench safety. Two of them -- including the field supervisor for all Moeves trench crews -- subsequently supervised the digging of the very trench that now so troubled Charles Shelton.',\n",
       " \"In his inspection report, Mr. Shelton wrote that he had recommended several immediate changes. Moeves Plumbing needed ''someone competent in trenching'' to train workers or ''at least to identify good and bad trenches and to provide trench protection and enforce compliance,'' he told a senior company official.\",\n",
       " \"His advice went unheeded. But the company's owner, Linda Moeves, did take one step. She called the OSHA director in Cincinnati, William M. Murphy, to complain.\",\n",
       " \"''She was agitated,'' Mr. Murphy recalled. Mr. Shelton had asked for records to show that she was training employees in trench safety and seeking to enforce safety rules. ''Why does he need to be asking to see these records?'' Mr. Murphy recalled her asking.\",\n",
       " \"He remembers telling her she would do well to show that she had trained her employees properly. ''And she said, 'You know that since that last case we've been trying to do the right thing.' ''\",\n",
       " 'Same Company, Another Death',\n",
       " 'Bill Murphy had not forgotten that last case, 13 years before.',\n",
       " \"Over more than two decades as the agency's chief in Cincinnati, Mr. Murphy had become a legendary figure within OSHA. He and his office had repeatedly received OSHA's highest awards for aggressive enforcement. His personal history gave him an appreciation for the lives of men like Patrick Walters. He was raised in Scott County, Tenn., one of the poorest counties in the country. The son of a coal miner and farmer who fathered 22 children, he was the first in his family to graduate from high school.\",\n",
       " \"''None of us are smart,'' Mr. Murphy, 61, said in an interview. ''We just work harder.''\",\n",
       " 'He knew about death on the job firsthand. One of his half brothers had been electrocuted on a power line; another had fallen to his death erecting steel decking. In one of his first jobs, in an aircraft plant, an explosion killed two men in his work area. Soon after, he went to work for OSHA.',\n",
       " \"When Mr. Shelton told him about the problems at Moeves Plumbing, Mr. Murphy's mind reeled back to 1989, to that last case and to how afterward Linda Moeves had pledged to do the right thing.\",\n",
       " 'Clint Daley, an inexperienced laborer just like Patrick Walters, had been digging a sewer line with a backhoe operator named Dan Callahan. The trench, 12 feet deep, was neither sloped nor shored. There was no trench box. Mr. Daley was in the trench when the walls cracked. Mr. Callahan shouted a warning.',\n",
       " \"''By the time he got turned around, it caved in,'' he said later in a deposition.\",\n",
       " \"What made Clint Daley's death particularly outrageous to Mr. Murphy was that his inspectors had three times before warned Moeves Plumbing's crews about trench safety -- in 1984, 1985 and 1986. They had issued safety pamphlets, and a $700 fine.\",\n",
       " 'Yet Moeves Plumbing had not bought any trench safety equipment. Nor had it provided any safety training, on trenches or anything else.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Murphy might have referred the Daley case to the Justice Department for prosecution. He had, after all, concluded that Clint Daley died because Moeves Plumbing willfully violated safety rules. But Mr. Murphy's response was tempered by his assessment of Linda Moeves.\",\n",
       " \"Her husband, the company's founder, had died in 1987, and though she had helped out in the office, it was not clear she had the skills to run a plumbing business. Her prior job was social director of a racket club.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. Murphy admired the way she had hung tough in the cutthroat contracting world. And when she was interviewed by OSHA about Mr. Daley's death, she pleaded ignorance -- about the prior OSHA warnings, about the $700 fine, even about there being federal safety rules for trenches.\",\n",
       " \"''She was too willing to trust her employees to do the right thing,'' Mr. Murphy said.\",\n",
       " 'Mrs. Moeves promised deep changes. She quickly enrolled in a trenching safety seminar. She bought hydraulic shoring equipment. She saw that her supervisors and backhoe crews learned trench safety. There would be regular safety meetings, a new safety director and a safety committee to correct hazards.',\n",
       " \"She also established a written safety policy. Trenches deeper than four feet would be sloped or shored ''as required by OSHA standards,'' the policy said. What's more, trenches would be inspected daily by either Mrs. Moeves or a field supervisor. Employees who broke the rules would be disciplined, and even fired after a fourth offense.\",\n",
       " 'Ultimately, Mr. Murphy fined Moeves Plumbing $13,700 for the violations that killed Mr. Daley.',\n",
       " 'Over the next three years, Moeves Plumbing was inspected five times and cited for seven relatively minor violations. Mr. Murphy concluded that Mrs. Moeves had learned a painful lesson.',\n",
       " \"Now, Mr. Shelton's inspection raised some pointed questions about the permanence of that lesson. Court records show that Moeves Plumbing's safety committee had not existed for years. Nor were there records of any trench inspections or of employees being disciplined for safety violations. Several Moeves workers said they could not recall Mrs. Moeves or her supervisors ever directing them to take precautions against trench collapses.\",\n",
       " \"''I was unpleasantly surprised,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''I had thought she had gotten her act together.''\",\n",
       " 'Wet, Deep and Deadly',\n",
       " \"About a week after Charles Shelton's inspection, Moeves Plumbing received a work order for a routine job running sewer and water lines into new homes about 40 miles north of Cincinnati.\",\n",
       " \"The job was assigned to John F. Kehrer, 49, an experienced backhoe operator. Patrick Walters typically worked as Mr. Kehrer's helper, doing the dirty work of laying, cutting and connecting pipes after Mr. Kehrer dug the trench. In a recent deposition given to lawyers for the Walters family, Mr. Kehrer described Patrick Walters as a hard worker who had never refused an instruction.\",\n",
       " 'On the first day of this job, though, Patrick Walters was unavailable. He had gone for treatment after being hit in the back by a backhoe bucket. A doctor prescribed painkillers and cleared him for work.',\n",
       " 'With another helper, Mr. Kehrer started to dig. In his deposition, he said seeping water had made him worried.',\n",
       " \"''It's never safe when there is water in there,'' he explained.\",\n",
       " \"''Why?''\",\n",
       " \"''Because everything is so unstable.''\",\n",
       " 'The trench was at least eight feet deep. Still, he said, they took no precautions.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Kehrer insisted in his deposition that he was not competent to assess the hazards. Yes, he had taken a 10-hour trench safety class with a prior employer. But he also said that he had forgotten most of what he learned, and had received no safety training in six years at Moeves Plumbing.',\n",
       " 'The next day, Mr. Kehrer returned to finish the job with Patrick Walters. There had been more rain overnight, a downpour that filled the trench. It took hours to pump the water out. Then he started to dig.',\n",
       " \"Moeves Plumbing's safety policy -- the one instituted after Clint Daley's death -- called for a field supervisor to inspect trenches daily. According to Mr. Kehrer, though, no supervisor inspected this trench.\",\n",
       " \"By early afternoon the trench was 10 feet deep. Its walls -- saturated with rainwater -- were neither shored nor sloped. There was no trench box, no ladder. It was time to cut a sewer pipe, the helper's job.\",\n",
       " \"Mr. Kehrer said he did not actually order Patrick Walters into the trench. ''He knew what to do,'' he said. But he acknowledged doing nothing to stop him, though he knew enough to recognize that the trench violated federal safety laws.\",\n",

Now it was a matter of pressing OSHA to refer the case to the Justice Department, and then pressing the Justice Department to prosecute.',\n",

       " \"It died in a four-page agreement signed on Nov. 27 by Mr. Dimling and the acting area director, Dennis A. Collins. In exchange for Moeves Plumbing's promise not to fight in court, OSHA agreed to one crucial change: The word ''willful'' was stricken from the violations in Patrick Walters's death.\",\n",
       " \"In its place, OSHA substituted the designation ''unclassified'' -- a term of art invented more than a decade ago by some of the nation's top corporate defense lawyers.\",\n",

So the lawyers dangled a carrot: If OSHA would replace the pejorative ''willful'' with the nonjudgmental ''unclassified,'' their clients would pay higher fines and make substantial safety improvements.\",\n",
       " 'In recent years, though, OSHA has been less and less zealous about collecting those carrots. In the case of Moeves Plumbing, OSHA agreed to cut its fines 40 percent, from $90,000 to $54,000. Moeves Plumbing could pay in four annual installments, with the first not due for another year. It was not required to admit any wrongdoing.',\n",

       " 'Still, from interviews with him and with the retired Mr. Murphy, as well as an examination of the available record, a much clearer -- and at the same time profoundly befuddling -- picture of what happened inside OSHA begins to emerge.',\n",
       " \"OSHA's final determination seems almost perverse. To begin with, the Chicago office would determine that the violations that killed Patrick Walters were more flagrant than Cincinnati thought -- yet would reduce the punishment. Stranger yet, Mrs. Moeves escaped a criminal referral not because of anything she did right, but because of something she did wrong.\",\n",
       " \"And in the end, OSHA would say that it had achieved ''a good solution'' by obtaining promises of additional vigilance and training -- the same promises Bill Murphy extracted after Clint Daley's death in 1989.\",\n",
       " \"When the Cincinnati office's formal recommendation came in, Mr. Connors said, it was much as Mr. Gilgrist had suggested that summer: it called for willful violations for Charles Shelton's first inspection only, on the ground that work had gone on under the noses of the two supervisors just trained in trench safety. Even so, the area office did recommend a ''significant penalty'' for both cases -- $101,500 -- which would have led to a review by Mr. Henshaw.\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Connors said that he and his assistants in Chicago disagreed with the Cincinnati office on both counts. First, they believed that the violations that killed Patrick Walters were indeed willful.',\n",
       " \"By law, a willful violation means the employer demonstrated either ''intentional disregard'' or ''plain indifference'' toward safety laws. Given the history -- indeed, the very recent history -- of trenching violations by Moeves Plumbing, Mr. Connors said he and his aides saw strong evidence of plain indifference, even if they could not prove that Mrs. Moeves was personally aware of the trench's unsafe conditions.\",\n",
       " 'Yet having decided that Moeves Plumbing had again killed a worker by willfully violating safety laws, the Chicago office decided that the case did not warrant a significant penalty. It reduced the proposed fine from $101,500 to $90,000. It also considered and rejected seeking a Justice Department review for possible prosecution.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Connors said he and his aides had argued long and hard to persuade the Cincinnati office that Patrick Walters's death warranted a willful violation. Wasn't he troubled, then, when the Cincinnati office, without his blessing, promptly dropped the willful designation in its settlement?\",\n",
       " \"''These are always a negotiation,'' he said.\",\n",
       " \"Recently, the Labor Department's top lawyer circulated a directive restating what he called a basic principle: ''special consideration'' should be given to referring cases ''where the employer's conduct is particularly egregious, such as where the employer has a history of similar violative conduct or of disregarding safety warnings.''\",\n",
       " \"Moeves Plumbing's history was considered, Mr. Connors said. But more important, he argued, was being able to show that Mrs. Moeves had ''specific knowledge'' that her men were working in an unsafe trench. Put another way, having censured Mrs. Moeves for violating a central principle of trench safety -- making sure the job was inspected and deemed safe -- OSHA then decided that she should be spared prosecution because that same failure meant she was not aware of the trench's perils.\",\n",
       " \"''The tragedy of this was it was clearly preventable,'' Mr. Connors said. ''Had the company followed the rules, this young man didn't have to die. And nobody feels good about that. We'd love to take it as far as we could and to somehow comfort the family. But I don't know there's anything that we had here that we could do that. And no, we don't feel good about that.''\",\n",
